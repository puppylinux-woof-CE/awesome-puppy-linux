# Why Puppy Linux is awesome

## Puppy is fast

[Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.com) is a lightweight Linux operating system,
with a fully featured desktop and a (surprisingly) huge [selection of programs](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=puppy&pkglist=true&version=8.0#pkglist)
installed by default.

Puppy runs super fast - the programs included in Puppy Linux are chosen for
their speed and small size, as well as being useful and user-friendly.

Puppy runs your programs in RAM, and minimises hard disk usage as much as possible.
It can even be setup to run the whole operating system in RAM so it's even faster
(at the cost of slightly slower boot times).

With Puppy Linux, even old PCs will run fast.

## Puppy is simple

Puppy doesn't even need to be installed - you can run it from an ISO file,
or a burned CD or DVD, with no need to install it on any drives at all.

You can, however, install Puppy on hard drives, USB sticks, SD cards and more.
Puppy comes with a `Universal Installer` program to help you install Puppy to
nearly anything!

You can have multiple Puppy installs on a _single partition_, or like other operating
system, across multiple partitions, if you prefer.

Puppy Linux can even be copied to an _existing partition_, alongside other operating
systems, without the need to format your drives or partitions. This includes
Windows drives like NTFS and FAT32 drives!

## Puppy is powerful

Puppy can be used as a desktop OS, a home file or media server, a fast gaming OS,
a rescue OS for fixing Windows and recovering data and it can go everywhere you
go - just take your Puppy Linux USB with you!

Puppy can be built from the packages of other distros. The currently supported
distros are:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Slackware

Puppy Linux offers access to the package repos of the distro from which it was
built - if your Puppy Linux was built from Ubuntu Bionic packages, then the
huge selection of Ubuntu Bionic packages and repos will be available in your
`Puppy Package Manager (PPM)`.

## Puppy is secure

Your OS settings are saved separate from the OS itself - in a save file or save
folder. This can be an encrypted file, for extra security.

You can choose retain your settings between reboots, or not. With Puppy Linux,
it's easy to boot a "fresh" or "pristine" install any time you like.

With Puppy you can keep your personal files and sensitive data separate from your
OS, even leaving no trace of previous activity between reboots.

## Puppy is faithful

Puppy is ideal for running on mediocre hardware, even the latest versions work great!

For users of very old hardware, who cannot recycle it but wish to keep using it,
even current versions of Puppy Linux might work for you. If not, there are older
versions of Puppy Linux which are still available, and will work great!

## Puppy is customisable

Puppy Linux is easy to customise.

You can easily rebuild your own custom version of Puppy Linux using the
`Remasterpup` program, available in `Menu->Setup`. You can change add or
remove packages, change themes, desktop environments and whatever else
you like.

There are other tools too, like [Woofy](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=57037),
a simple GUI for building custom Puppy Linux versions from an ISO file.

In fact, it's _so easy_ to `remaster` a custom Puppy Linux derivative (or "puplet")
that there's a whole forum section dedicated to [Puppy Derivatives](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/index.php?f=35).

Puppy is more "hackable" than most other distros - it's system scripts are often
shell scripts, as well as many of it's main programs. The learning curve to
start making Programs for Puppy is quite low compared to other operating systems.

## Puppy has a great community

The [Puppy Linux Forums](http://murga-linux/com/puppy/) are among the friendliest Linux forums on the internet.

**We pride ourselves on welcoming newbies, novices, and experts alike.**

The forum is very egalitarian - all users are equal, everyone gets to have a say
in "what Puppy should be", and everyone can submit scripts, patches, new
programs etc right away - without the need to submit a 1000 posts first, like
_some_ Linux forums ;)
